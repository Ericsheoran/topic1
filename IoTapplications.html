    <h1> SELF-INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <p> HI, My name is Aditya Sheoran and I am from Rohtak, Haryana. It's my second year in BE Software Engineering at Chitkara University, Rajpura Punjab.</p>
    <h1> Description of Activities </h1>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 1:- </h2>
    <p>  In this activity, I learned about the IoT applications, as IoT means Internet of Things and describes the network of physical objects which are connected with some software or other technologies. Some examples like- Self Healing machines, Home Security etc. I also learned about the features needed in IoT application in this activity. </p>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 2:- </h2>
    <p> In this activity, I came to know about the role of 'smart building' in the IoT applications. How this smart makes the devices better and how the devices work along with smart building. Actually, smart building makes the device more interactive, digital and easy to use. </h2>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 3:- </h2>
    <p> In this activity, I learned about thecontrol interface required for a smart building IoT application. I also learned about the high level features required for this interface, who are the users and  What are the parts needed to make this work. </h2>
